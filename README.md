# DOA
This project uses multiple spectral estimation algorithms to image and compare various algorithms.

The running order is:
inital_parameters->main|main_bias

The main function is made up of several parts:
echo_constuction|ESPRIT_restruction|FT_restruction
L1SVD_restruction|OMP_restruction|TSBL_restructure
error_calculation|

The main algorithm function in ESPRIT_restruction is :
tls_espritcomplex.m|ssp.m|mssp.m

The main algorithm function in OMP_restruction is :
cs_omp.m|ssp.m|mssp.m

The main algorithm function in TSBL_restruction is :
TSBL.m
